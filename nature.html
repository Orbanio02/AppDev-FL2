      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Blockbusters and Indie Films</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The film industry is characterized by a diverse range of movies, from high-budget blockbusters to low-budget indie films. Blockbusters are typically backed by major studios, featuring big-name actors, advanced special effects, and extensive marketing campaigns. These films aim to attract large audiences and generate significant box office revenue.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">In contrast, indie films are often produced by independent filmmakers and studios. These films usually have smaller budgets but offer more creative freedom. Indie films are known for their unique storytelling, character-driven plots, and artistic experimentation. They often tackle unconventional themes and provide fresh perspectives on various subjects.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Coexistence and Impact</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Despite their differences, blockbusters and indie films coexist and contribute to the richness of the film industry. Blockbusters drive the commercial side of cinema, drawing large audiences and generating substantial profits. This financial success often enables studios to invest in a wider variety of films, including indie projects.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Indie films, on the other hand, bring innovation and diversity to the industry. They often serve as a platform for new talent, both in front of and behind the camera. Film festivals, such as Sundance and Cannes, play a crucial role in promoting indie films, providing them with a stage to reach broader audiences and gain critical acclaim.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Streaming platforms have further blurred the lines between blockbusters and indie films. Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu offer a vast library of both types of films, making them accessible to viewers worldwide. This democratization of content has allowed indie films to reach audiences they might not have otherwise.</p>
